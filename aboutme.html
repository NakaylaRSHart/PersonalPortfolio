        <p class="AboutMe">
            My name is Nakayla Hart, I am a web developer in training.
             I have gone to college about two years originally for a Food Science Bachelors degree.
              I ended up changing my mind when I wanted to pursue in codeing instead.
              My husband and biggest supporter was on board with me taking an online bootcamp where I would learn Web Development.
